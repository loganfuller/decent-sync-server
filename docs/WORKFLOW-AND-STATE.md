# Workflow changes and machine state transitions

Ticket [#13](https://github.com/loganfuller/decent-sync/issues/13) extends
protocol version 1 with two deliveries, defined and validated in `protocol/`:

| Direction | Message | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin to server | `workflow` | `id` (delivery id), `observedAt`, `workflow` (opaque, as Decaid's `workflowUpdated` event gave it) |
| Plugin to server | `machineState` | `id`, `observedAt`, `state` and `substate` (Decaid's names, such as `espresso` and `preinfusion`) |

Both are acknowledged with `ack` once stored, or set aside because storing
them fails in a way that would repeat, as Shots are (`AI_PROTOCOL_NOTES.md`,
Deliveries set aside). The protocol version stays 1, as it does for any
change until v1 (ADR-0017).

## Plugin

`plugin/src/machine-events.ts` turns Decaid's events into deliveries, through
the plugin's one outbox (`plugin/src/outbox.ts`), which Shots share:

- `workflowUpdated` carries the whole Workflow. Decaid sends it just after
  loading the plugin and on every change (`PluginManager` in
  `decaid:lib/src/plugins/plugin_manager.dart`), so the plugin never reads
  `GET /workflow`. Every one is sent.
- `stateUpdate` arrives several times a second while a machine is connected.
  Only a change of state or substate from the last one queued is sent.
- On every `welcome`, the latest Workflow is sent again in a new delivery,
  observed then, replacing one an earlier `welcome` queued if that is still
  queued, and the next state update is sent whatever it is. A reconnect may
  stand for other hardware, after a tablet moved to another machine. A
  delivery still queued from the last connection may already have been
  stored for the last hardware, and its resend then changes nothing, so the
  new hardware gets the Workflow only from this new delivery. The server
  records nothing for either if it is unchanged.
- When the server sends `requestCollections`, as when the Machine's Location
  changes, the latest Workflow is sent again the same way, before the
  collections, so it is taken in at the new Location: its settings give way
  to the Location's, and its grinder and batch are cleared if the Location
  does not offer them (`LIBRARY.md`, Joining a Location).

`observedAt` is when the plugin observed the event, from its own clock in UTC
(`new Date().toISOString()`), because the outbox may deliver it minutes later.
A state update's own `timestamp` is the tablet's local time without an offset,
like a Shot's sample times, so it is not used; the validator refuses a time
without its `Z`. Deliveries go in order, one awaiting acknowledgment at a
time, and what a connection left unacknowledged is sent again first on the
next, with the same delivery ids, ahead of the Workflow sent on `welcome`, so
a reconnect never replaces changes made while disconnected. A reload sends the
current Workflow, and the next state update, again.

### Kept across unloads

Ticket [#93](https://github.com/loganfuller/decent-sync/issues/93) makes
these deliveries survive an unload. The outbox keeps each Workflow and
machine state delivery in Decaid's plugin storage until the server
acknowledges it (`plugin/src/kept-deliveries.ts`, through the commands of
`plugin/src/storage.ts`, which the tablet's id shares):

- **Written before it is sent.** A delivery is written to plugin storage, and
  the record of what is kept after it, and is sent only once Decaid has
  answered both, in whichever order they land: a write still waiting its
  turn takes the data of a later write to the same key, so the queue of
  writes stays bounded however slow Decaid is. One acknowledged, or replaced
  as the Workflow sent on the last `welcome` is, is removed from what is
  kept, its key overwritten by its sequence number alone. Decaid answers each
  command with an event, one at a time; a write it leaves unanswered for
  10 s counts as failed, is logged, and the delivery is sent anyway, perhaps
  kept only in memory. From then on, until Decaid answers anything again,
  writes are sent without waiting for answers, so a Decaid failing every
  write holds up no delivery and logs once. As the plugin unloads, it sends
  the writes still waiting their turn without waiting for answers, the one
  awaiting an answer again first, as Decaid finishes a retiring generation's
  writes but drops one it received just before if it handles the unload
  first; so an acknowledgment that arrives just before an unload is recorded
  and its delivery not sent again.
- **Sent first after a reload.** As it loads, before it sends anything, the
  plugin reads back what earlier loads kept and queues it, oldest first,
  ahead of everything queued since, such as the Workflow Decaid sends after
  loading it. Each goes with its original delivery id and `observedAt`, so the
  server's handling of each delivery once still applies (below), as for a
  reconnect. Reading them back stops at any read Decaid fails or leaves
  unanswered, never taking it for nothing kept, logs it, and starts again
  after 5 s, doubling to at most 5 minutes, until it succeeds. Nothing is
  sent meanwhile, Shots and collections included, so nothing kept is ever
  sent after a newer delivery. This rests on Decaid's reads failing all
  together: it reads the plugin's storage from memory, so a read fails only
  when its store does, or when it does not answer in 10 s, and a Decaid that
  cannot read the plugin's storage as the plugin loads cannot read the
  tablet's id either, without which the plugin does not connect. Workflow
  and machine state deliveries queued meanwhile, for the time 2,001 reads at
  most take, or longer while Decaid fails them, are held to the limits
  below, and kept once the reading back ends: an unload before then loses
  them. Nothing kept sends nothing extra.
- **Under the token they were made with.** Deliveries belong to the token's
  Machine, and the server records each delivery id per Machine, so the key
  `outbox` also holds a 32-bit hash of the token, never the token. A load
  with another token, as after a barista enters another Machine's token,
  which reloads the plugin, sends none of what was kept, logs it, and
  overwrites it.
- **Bounded.** Decaid stores no null, so `host.storage` deletes no key, and
  it keeps a plugin's whole storage in memory. So deliveries are kept in a
  ring of 2,000 keys, `outbox.0` to `outbox.1999`, reused in turn, each
  holding one delivery with its sequence number, and the key `outbox` holds
  the range of sequence numbers kept; a key whose delivery is acknowledged or
  dropped holds only its sequence number. At most 2,000 deliveries are kept, about
  a busy day of a Machine's state transitions, and at most 2 Mi characters of
  their JSON (`MAX_KEPT` and `MAX_KEPT_CHARACTERS`), which a few hundred
  Workflows reach first. Keeping one more past either drops the oldest, from
  memory too, unless it has been sent; the plugin logs that it is dropping
  some once per connection. The server's history then has a gap before the
  oldest it receives, and the Workflow and state sent on the next `welcome`
  still bring the current ones. In memory too, the outbox holds no more of
  them than it keeps, but for one sent and awaiting its acknowledgment, and
  while it reads back what was kept, those read back as well as those held
  meanwhile. It holds new Shots and Steam Records by their ids until it sends
  them (`SHOTS.md`, `STEAM_RECORDS.md`); only Shot edits, one per edit, are
  held whole, as before.
- **Not kept.** Shots, Steam Records, their indices and collections keep
  milestone 1's recovery: every load scans and indexes the tablet's records,
  the server requests what it lacks, and every `welcome` sends each
  collection. The answers to the server's Library writes are not kept either
  (`LIBRARY.md`, How the plugin writes).

Resetting the tablet's Decaid data loses what is kept, as it loses the
tablet's id. A Decaid backup holds it as it holds the id, and restoring one
sends again what was kept when it was taken: the server changes nothing for a
delivery whose id it still has (below).

## Server

`server/src/machine-events/machine-events.service.ts` appends each delivery to
`workflow_events` or `machine_state_events`, handling each delivery once.

First it locks whoever the event belongs to (below), then records the
delivery's id in `machine_event_deliveries`, keyed by the token's Machine,
whether or not the delivery turns out to change anything
(`creditFirstDelivery` in `server/src/machines/credit.ts`). A delivery whose
id is already recorded is acknowledged and changes nothing: the plugin keeps a
delivery's id when it sends it again, and always through the same token, so a
resend changes nothing, through any connection or instance, even after other
changes, and even when the first delivery changed nothing either. A resend
arriving while the first is still being stored waits for it, at that lock or
on the record's key.

The lock comes first because the record references the token's Machine, and
whatever writes a row referencing a Machine locks first (`lockMachine` in
`server/src/machines/machines.service.ts`). Recorded first, the record's
foreign-key check held the Machine's row against an update of its model and
serial while the delivery waited for the row lock, so a hello or an Admin
binding the Machine's hardware under that lock deadlocked with it.

Each id is kept for 90 days from when it was recorded, by PostgreSQL's clock
(`DELIVERY_ID_RETENTION_DAYS` in `server/src/machines/delivery-id-cleanup.ts`).
Every server instance deletes older ones as it starts and then hourly, at
most 1,000 in each statement, oldest first. Each statement runs on its own,
outside any delivery's transaction, and skips rows another transaction has
locked, so it waits for no delivery, and instances running it at once delete
different rows. A failed run is logged and the next tries again. The index on
`received_at` finds the rows to delete.

Deleting them is safe because a resend comes from the plugin on its next
welcomed connection, or from its next load, which reads back the deliveries
kept in plugin storage (above), far sooner than 90 days unless the plugin
stays unloaded, or the server unreachable, that long, or an old Decaid backup
is restored. A resend that comes later anyway is handled as a new delivery.
Only one delivery awaits acknowledgment at a time, so only that one can have
been stored without the plugin knowing, and it is sent again ahead of
anything newer. It is stored only if it differs from the latest event, so at
worst it puts one stale event after a newer one another tablet's mismatched
session stored for the same Machine.

An event belongs to the session's token's Machine, or for a mismatched
session, to its reported hardware: the Machine that has it, or else its
Pending Machine (ADR-0015), as an inferred Shot or a Steam Record is
(`creditReporter` in `server/src/machines/credit.ts`). Whoever is chosen is
locked: the Machine's row, or the hardware's advisory lock for a Pending
Machine. Under that lock, one statement inserts the event unless the latest
event stored for the same Machine or Pending Machine (the highest `id`) has
the same Workflow (jsonb equality) or state and substate. That makes the
history transitions only, judged by what is stored rather than what any
instance or connection remembers, so it holds across reconnects, instances and
restarts. A mismatched session's events are judged against the latest of
whoever has its hardware, so a tablet moved onto another Machine's hardware
adds only what changes that Machine's own. Creating a machine entry for a
Pending Machine's hardware, binding it at `hello` or entering it by hand hands
its events over with its Shots and Steam Records (`transferPendingRecords`).

A Workflow from a connection that is not mismatched, for its token's
Machine, is also taken into its Location's steam, hot water and rinse
settings in the same transaction (ticket #86,
`LIBRARY.md`, Steam, hot water and rinse settings): only those settings count
as edits, timed by `observedAt`. While the plugin writes the shared settings
into the Workflow, it holds back the `workflowUpdated` its write causes until
the write's answer is queued, then sends the latest Workflow, so the server
reads its own write as the answer rather than as the tablet's edit.

The current Workflow and machine state are the latest events stored, which
for one tablet are also the latest observed. `observed_at` keeps the tablet's
time, which may be wrong or jump; `received_at` is PostgreSQL's.

Known limits: a state update that arrives on a connection whose `hello`
reported no machine belongs to the token's Machine, as everything on that
connection does, until the plugin reconnects with the hardware the machine
then reports (ADR-0015). While the server is unreachable for long, the plugin
keeps only the newest 2,000 events, up to 2 Mi characters (above).

## REST API

All endpoints require the account session, and answer 404 for an unknown
Machine. Pending Machines' events are not exposed; they appear on the Machine
that takes their hardware over. Staff read them as Admins do.

- `GET /api/machines` and `GET /api/machines/:id` include `machineState:
  { state, substate, observedAt } | null`, the latest stored.
- `GET /api/machines/:id/workflow` returns `{ workflow }`, the latest Workflow
  event `{ id, observedAt, receivedAt, workflow }` or null; `workflow` is
  Decaid's, as sent.
- `GET /api/machines/:id/workflow-events?limit=20&offset=0` and
  `GET /api/machines/:id/machine-state-events?limit=20&offset=0` return
  `{ events, total, limit, offset }`, latest first. A state event is
  `{ id, state, substate, observedAt, receivedAt }`. Limit is 1–100.

The Machines list shows each Machine's state and last Shot; the Machine page
also shows its current Workflow, loaded every 30 s rather than every 5 s as
the state is.

`server/test/machine-events.test.ts` covers this through Seam 1, with the
built plugin and raw frames on two instances sharing PostgreSQL,
`server/test/durable-outbox.test.ts` the deliveries kept across unloads and
their bound, and
`e2e/workflow-and-state.spec.ts` the management interface.
`server/test/binding-deadlocks.test.ts` races deliveries, collections
included, against a hello or an Admin binding the Machine's hardware, in
both orders.
